## üîÑ **INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEM**

### Database Requirements
The enhanced dashboard expects these data structures:

```typescript
interface UserSubmission {
  id: string;
  code: string;
  description: string;
  severity: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  common_causes: string[];
  vehicle_info: {
    make: string;
    model: string;
    year: number;
    engine?: string;
  };
  user_experience: string;
  status: "pending" | "approved" | "rejected";
  submitted_at: string;
  contact_info?: {
    name?: string;
    email?: string;
  };
}
```

### API Endpoints Needed
```typescript
// User submissions
POST /api/obd-submissions     // Create new submission
GET /api/obd-submissions      // Get all submissions (admin)
PUT /api/obd-submissions/:id  // Update submission status

// Parts with images
POST /api/parts               // Create part with images
PUT /api/parts/:id            // Update part with images
GET /api/parts                // Get all parts with search/filter
```
